Downloading Bootstrap
You will use npm to fetch the Bootstrap files for use within your project. Thereafter you need to install JQuery and Popper.js as shown below since Bootstrap 4 depends on these two. At the prompt, type the following to fetch Bootstrap files to your project folder:

npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 --save
npm install jquery@3.3.1 popper.js@1.12.9 --save
